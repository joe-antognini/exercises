    "The sample space is a union of an infinite number of subsets, each with a unique number of elements $k$, where $k \\in \\{2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ or $k \\in \\{k \\in \\mathbb{N}^+ : k \\geq 2 \\}$.  The subset with $k$ elements consists of $k - 1$ elements, each of which has a $T$ at the end and for which the $i^{\\textrm{th}}$ element has a $T$ in the $i^{\\textrm{th}}$ spot.  So, in all the sample space looks like:\n",
