A list of my solutions to Project Euler problems.  Most solutions are
calculated using Mathematica, but some are calculated using Python.  In my
first pass through these problems I'm simply using whatever language is
presents the path of least resistance to the answer.  In the future I may
use these problems as exercises to practice new languages so solutions to
some problems may appear in multiple languages.
